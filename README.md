# 3-SAT-Problem-Solver
Implementation of local search algorithms for solving 3-SAT problems

# Summary
3SAT, or the Boolean satisfiability problem, is a problem that asks what is the fastest algorithm to tell for a given formula in Boolean algebra (with unknown number of variables) whether it is satisfiable, that is, whether there is some combination of the (binary) values of the variables that will give 1.
For solving these particular problem i used two local search algorithms GSAT and WALKSAT. 


# Source files
• Literal : Here is defined the literal class that concerns Literals and their structure.

• Clause: Here is defined the class of Clauses, their structure and functions related to extracting data from them.

• CNF: Defines the CNF formula and functions for data extraction and inference necessary to implement the GSAT and WALKSAT algorithms

• GSATWALKSAT: It is the main part of the program, definition of main, input of user values and of course the implementation of the two algorithms.
